step1- init git repo
step2- init dvc repo
step3- add code to your training files
step4- run DVC live with context manager and log_param() and log_metric()
step5- run training.py file
step6- params and metric get logged in 'dvclive' folder for current experiment, params.yaml and dvc.yaml also created
step7- change the parameter value and run the training file again
step8- second experiment will also get logged 


History of experiment is maintained in temp folder in .dvc folder

step 9- create a new branch for the best  experiment using 'dvc exp branch' command
step10- checkout to this new branch for further development



The whole philosophy of experiment tracking in DVC is to declutter our git commands and only to save those experiment which are best among all and leave others in the dvc cache folder.

step11- use 'dvc exp apply' to switch between experiment
step 12- use command 'dvc exp diff'  to compare parameter and metrics among two experiments and see the change of values between two
